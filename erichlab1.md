# CD COMMAND
## No argument command and output: No output, command:[user@sahara ~]$ cd
**Working Directory:** /home
**Explanation:** I believe the output is blank because cd is used to move between directories,
but it needs the argument of where to go to. 
**Error?** I wouldn't call it an error because it is blank. It moved back to the home directory.

## Directory as an argument command and output: No output, command: [user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
**Working Directory:** /home/lecture1
**Explanation:** This output or lack thereof means that the command worked and the one visible change
was the prompt now containing lecture1: [user@sahara ~/lecture1]$
**Error?** Not an error
