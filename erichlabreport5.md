### Student Post

**Sample Student** : Hello, Sample TA. I was working on the implementation for the merge method in my ListExamples.java file. This takes two sorted lists of strings (so "a" appears before "b" and so on), and returns a new list that has all the strings in both lists in sorted order. I use my bash script to assess my progress. This simple script clones the input repository link and extracts the file. It checks if the file is there and valid, and then proceeds to copy the path of the test file and the student file, before running the tests from TestListExamples.java on my version of ListExamples.java. I believe there is a bug in my file. The output of my bash script is attached below.
